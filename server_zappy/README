--- Food ---
bool            setbox_addfood(uint x, uint y, uint nb);
ok

ok

uint		getbox_nbfood(uint x, uint y);
ok

--- Stones ---

bool            setbox_addstone(uint x, uint y, e_stone type, uint nb);
Add "nb" stones of type "type" at position "x", "y".
Return false on failure (invalid position, allocation failed).

bool            setbox_delstone(uint x, uint y, e_stone type, uint nb)
Remove "nb" stones of type "type" at position "x", "y"
Return false on failure (invalid position, invalid stone type).
If stone->nb < nb, stone->nb = 0

uint		getbox_nbstones(uint x, uint y, e_stone type);
Return how many stones of type "type" are at position "x", "y".
Return 0 if position is invalid.

--- Players ---

t_player *		new_player(void);
create a new blank player.

bool			setbox_add_player(t_player * player,
			char * name, uint x, uint y);
Add the player "player" in team "name" at position "x", "y" on the map.
If team didnt exist, team is created.
Return false on failure (invalid position, allocation failed).

t_list *		get_box_players(unit x, uint y);
Return the list of players at position "x", "y".

void			setbox_del_player(t_player * player);
delete a player (and remove pointers everywhere o__o).

--- Teams ---

t_team *		get_team_by_name(char * name);
return the team "name" or NULL if the team didnt exists.

t_team *		get_team_of_player(t_player * player);
return the team where player is.

t_list *		get_teams(void);
return the list of teams.

/* --------------------------------- PLAYER -------------------------------- */


t_player        *get_player_by_id(uint id);
return a player by his id

--- Level ---

uint            get_player_level(uint id);
return the level of a player or 0 if invalid id

--- Position --

bool            get_player_pos(uint id, uint *x, uint *y);
set x, y to the position of the player id. return false if id is invalid

--- Food ---

uint get_player_food(uint id);
return the food (= life) of the player (0 if invalid id)

bool            player_addfood(uint id, uint nb);
bool            player_delfood(uint id, uint nb)


--- Stones ---

t_list * /* t_stone */  get_player_stones(uint id);
return the list of stones of the player.
t_stone : e_stone type; uint nb;

uint		get_player_nbstones(uint id, e_stone type);
Return how many stones of type "type" player id have
Return 0 if id is invalid.

todo :

bool            set_player_addstone(uint id, e_stone type, uint nb);
Add "nb" stones of type "type" to player id
Return false on failure (invalid id, allocation failed).

bool            set_player_delstone(uint id, e_stone type, uint nb);
Remove "nb" stones of type "type" to player id
Return false on failure (invalid id, invalid stone type).
If stone->nb < nb, stone->nb = 0
